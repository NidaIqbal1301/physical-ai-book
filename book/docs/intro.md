# Introduction to Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics

Welcome to the Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics book, where we explore how to bridge digital AI models with physical robotic systems. This book will guide you through the essential concepts and practical implementations required to build autonomous humanoid robots.

## Book Modules

This book is organized into four core modules:

1. **Module 1: The Robotic Nervous System (ROS 2)** - Learn how to connect digital AI agents with physical robots using ROS 2.
2. **Module 2: The Digital Twin (Gazebo & Unity)** - Explore physics simulation and environment building for humanoid robots.
3. **Module 3: The AI-Robot Brain (NVIDIA Isaac)** - Discover advanced perception and AI training systems.
4. **Module 4: Vision-Language-Action (VLA)** - Understand how LLMs enable cognitive planning in robots.

## Learning Objectives

- Understand the principles of Physical AI and embodied intelligence
- Learn to work with ROS 2 for robot control
- Master digital twin simulation techniques
- Apply NVIDIA Isaac for perception and navigation
- Integrate multimodal AI pipelines for autonomous behavior
