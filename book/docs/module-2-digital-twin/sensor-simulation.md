# Sensor Simulation

This chapter covers the simulation of various sensors including LiDAR, depth cameras, and IMUs for humanoid robots.

## Sensor Types

- LiDAR: Simulating 2D and 3D laser range finders
- Depth Cameras: RGB-D sensor simulation
- IMUs: Inertial measurement unit simulation
- Other sensors: Force/torque, GPS, etc.

## Learning Objectives

- Configure sensor simulation for humanoid robots
- Understand sensor noise models and limitations
- Apply sensor simulation to perception system development
