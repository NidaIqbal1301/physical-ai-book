# ROS 2 Nodes, Topics, and Services

This chapter dives deeper into the communication patterns in ROS 2 that form the backbone of humanoid robot control systems.

## Communication Patterns

- Nodes: Individual processes that perform computation
- Topics: Named buses over which nodes exchange messages (publish/subscribe model)
- Services: Synchronous request/response communication (client/server model)

## Implementation Considerations

- When to use topics vs services
- Message types and interfaces
- Quality of Service (QoS) settings

## Learning Objectives

- Implement nodes that communicate via topics and services
- Understand the differences between communication patterns
- Apply appropriate communication patterns to humanoid robot systems
