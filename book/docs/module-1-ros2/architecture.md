# ROS 2 Architecture

This chapter covers the fundamental architecture of ROS 2 that enables communication between different components of a humanoid robot system.

## Core Concepts

- Nodes: Individual processes that perform computation
- Topics: Named buses over which nodes exchange messages
- Services: Synchronous request/response communication
- Actions: Asynchronous request/response communication with feedback

## Learning Objectives

- Understand how ROS 2 nodes communicate with each other
- Learn about topics, services, and actions in ROS 2
- Apply ROS 2 architecture concepts to humanoid robot control
