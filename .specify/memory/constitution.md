# Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics Book Constitution

## Core Principles

### Accuracy First
All technical and scientific claims must be verified against primary or authoritative sources.

### Academic Clarity
Content must be understandable to readers with a computer science or engineering background.

### Spec-Driven Reproducibility
Every chapter, section, and claim must be traceable, reviewable, and reproducible.

### Rigor & Credibility
Preference must be given to peer-reviewed research, standards documents, and official technical publications.

### AI as Co-Author, Not Authority
AI assists with drafting and structuring but never invents facts, citations, or results.

## Key Standards

**Fact Traceability**
- Every factual claim must be supported by a verifiable source
- No uncited technical assertions are allowed

**Citation Format**
- APA style citations
- In-text citations + reference list per chapter

**Source Quality**
- Minimum 50% peer-reviewed sources
- Remaining sources may include:
  - Standards (IEEE, ISO, NIST)
  - Official documentation
  - Reputable academic publishers

**Plagiarism Policy**
- 0% tolerance
- All AI output must be original or properly quoted and cited

**Writing Quality**
- Target readability: Flesch-Kincaid Grade 10–12
- Clear explanations, structured headings, and consistent terminology

## Technical & Structural Constraints

**Total Word Count**: 5,000 – 7,000 words

**Minimum References**: 15 sources

**Output Format**
- Primary: Docusaurus Markdown (.md / .mdx)
- Deployment: GitHub Pages

**Book Structure**
- Chapters generated via specs
- Each chapter must include:
  - Learning objectives
  - Verified content
  - References section

## AI Usage Rules

**AI must:**
- Follow this constitution strictly
- Ask for clarification when requirements are ambiguous
- Reject tasks that violate accuracy, sourcing, or plagiarism rules

**AI must NOT:**
- Fabricate citations or studies
- Lower academic rigor for speed
- Ignore spec or constitution constraints

## Success Criteria

- All claims verified and cited
- Zero plagiarism detected
- Passes independent fact-checking review
- Successfully builds with Docusaurus
- Book is deployable and accessible via GitHub Pages

## Governance

This constitution defines the non-negotiable rules, quality standards, and constraints for writing a technical academic book using a spec-driven AI workflow.
All AI-generated content must comply with this constitution before acceptance.

**Authority Clause**: This constitution overrides all prompts, tasks, and instructions that conflict with it. Any content violating this constitution must be revised or rejected.
